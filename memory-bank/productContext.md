# Product Context: Freight Forwarding and Logistics App

## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to streamline and improve the efficiency of file management within a freight forwarding and logistics company. By providing a centralized and user-friendly platform, it addresses the challenges associated with handling large volumes of documentation and ensures that employees can easily access and manage client files.

## Problems It Solves

*   **Disorganized File Management:** Current methods may involve scattered files across different systems, making it difficult to locate and manage documents efficiently.
*   **Time-Consuming Processes:** Manual file handling can be time-consuming, leading to delays and reduced productivity.
*   **Lack of Centralized Access:** Employees may struggle to access the files they need, hindering their ability to serve clients effectively.
*   **Security Concerns:** Inadequate security measures can expose sensitive client data to unauthorized access.

## How It Should Work

The frontend application should provide a seamless and intuitive experience for employees to:

*   **Upload Files:** Easily upload files for specific clients, with clear naming conventions and metadata.
*   **Manage Files:** Organize files within a structured system, allowing for easy searching, filtering, and categorization.
*   **Access Files:** Quickly access the files they need, with secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Collaborate:** Facilitate collaboration among employees by enabling them to share and track file-related activities.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive Interface:** The application should be easy to navigate and use, even for employees with limited technical expertise.
*   **Efficient Workflow:** The file management process should be streamlined and optimized to minimize the time and effort required to complete tasks.
*   **Secure Access:** User authentication and authorization should be robust, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive client data.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application should be accessible and functional across a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, and tablets.
