# Progress

## What Works

*   Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## What's Left to Build

*   Implement the file upload functionality.
*   Design the file management interface.
*   Integrate with the backend API for file storage and retrieval.
*   Implement user authentication and authorization.
*   Implement file search functionality.

## Current Status

*   The project is in the initial stages of development.
*   The core memory bank files have been created and populated with initial information.

## Known Issues

*   None at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   The decision to use React and Tailwind CSS was based on their popularity, ease of use, and suitability for building a responsive user interface.
