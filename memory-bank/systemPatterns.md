# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The frontend application follows a component-based architecture using React. It is designed to interact with a backend API for data storage and retrieval. The main components include:

*   **File Upload Component:** Handles the uploading of client files.
*   **File Management Component:** Provides tools for organizing, searching, and filtering files.
*   **File Access Component:** Enables secure access to client files based on user roles and permissions.

## Key Technical Decisions

*   **React:** Chosen as the primary framework for building the user interface due to its component-based architecture and large community support.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Selected for styling and layout due to its utility-first approach and ease of customization.

## Design Patterns in Use

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is structured as a collection of reusable components, promoting modularity and maintainability.
*   **API Integration:** The frontend interacts with the backend API using asynchronous requests, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Component Relationships

*   The `File Upload Component` sends files to the backend API for storage.
*   The `File Management Component` retrieves file metadata from the backend API and displays it in a structured format.
*   The `File Access Component` uses authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to client files.

## Critical Implementation Paths

*   **File Upload:** The file upload process involves selecting a file, sending it to the backend API, and updating the file management interface.
*   **File Search:** The file search process involves querying the backend API for files matching specific criteria and displaying the results in the file management interface.
*   **User Authentication:** The user authentication process involves verifying user credentials against a backend authentication service and granting access to the application based on user roles and permissions.
